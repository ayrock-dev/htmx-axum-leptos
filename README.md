# htmx-axum-leptos

A Rust frontend? Who me? :crab:

Trying a thing inspired by [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen).

:crab: Stack:

- [htmx](htmx.org) client markup + interactivity
- [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) web server
- [leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos) ssr
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) because tech twitter said so

This stack needs a name. htmaxum? We can rebrand to MAX in a year and launch an entirely new app.

## Getting started

```
cargo run
```
